To explore density-based clustering techniques, implement DBSCAN and an alternative HDBSCAN algorithms, compare their performance on different datasets(digits, seeds and tumor datasets).

Performed relative cluster validation by adjusting input parameters of the chosen algorithm and visualized the clustering performance comparison on different datasets.

Proposed a suitable method to confirm the validity of the clustering results for all the datasets, and the findings were reported.
